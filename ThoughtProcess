I knew that I could use Encapsulation for an Exercise and Exercise test class from doing homework at Tech Elevator.
 - Made an instance of Exercise in TestExercise...gives access to the firstOccurrence method.

Next I had to figure out how to sort the array (DOES IT NEED TO BE SORTED?) because the problem states the array is sorted.
 - Arrays.sort(nums) -- passing the array as an argument
 - nums[0] = first number in the array = smallest number in the array (BECAUSE IT'S SORTED)

Tested the method in Test Exercise
 - firstOccurrence being the method displaying the correct answer (nums[0])
 - testingWrongAnswer expecting to come back wrong (nums[1])
